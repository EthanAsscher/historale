## 1. ADS SETUP

### The Honest Truth About AdSense
AdSense has gotten stricter. For a single-page game site, you might face
initial rejection because Google now looks for:
- Privacy Policy, About, Contact pages
- Multiple pages of content (they like 15-20+ pages)
- Domain age of 3+ months ideally

### Your Best Path:

**PHASE 1: Launch WITHOUT ads (Week 1-4)**
- Focus entirely on getting traffic first
- A clean, ad-free game is more shareable
- People are more likely to link to it / share it
- This is what Wordle did — no ads at first, pure growth

**PHASE 2: Add a Privacy Policy + About page (Week 1)**
You need these regardless. I can build these for you. They should live at:
- historale.com/privacy (or privacy.html)
- historale.com/about (or about.html)

**PHASE 3: Apply to AdSense (Month 2-3)**
Once you have:
- Some traffic (even 50-100 daily visitors)
- Privacy Policy + About pages
- The domain is a few weeks old
Apply at: https://www.google.com/adsense/start

**PHASE 4: Graduate to Mediavine (50K+ sessions/month)**
This is where real money starts. Mediavine RPMs are 4-5x AdSense.
Apply at: https://www.mediavine.com/

### Alternative: Start With These Instead of AdSense
- **Ko-fi / Buy Me a Coffee** — add a tip jar link ("Enjoying Historale? Buy me a coffee")
- **Affiliate links** — link to history books on Amazon in the "More Games" section
- **Remove ads tier** — once ads are live, offer $3/month ad-free (use Stripe)

Title: I made a free game where you guess if historical events are real or fake — some of the real ones are absolutely wild

Body: It's called Historale — you get a historical "fact" and have to decide
if it actually happened or if it's made up.

The trick is that the real events sound completely fake (like Australia
losing a war against emus, or a pope putting a dead body on trial) and
the fake ones sound totally plausible.

It's streak-based — one wrong answer and you're done. My best is 12.

Would love to know what you think — I'm planning to make more games
like this.

Title: Historale — "Real or Fake History?" streak game I built

Body: Simple concept: you get a historical event and decide if it's real
or fabricated. Get one wrong and your streak ends.

The fun part is how wrong your intuition is. A chicken living 18 months
without its head? Real. Marco Polo bringing fireworks from China? Fake.

Title: I built a game that tests whether you can tell real historical
events from convincing fakes — it's harder than you'd think

Body: Some examples of REAL events in the game:
- The last guillotine execution in France was the same year Star Wars released (1977)
- Oxford University is older than the Aztec Empire
- Napoleon was attacked by a horde of rabbits

And FAKE events that sound real:
- Julius Caesar banned left-handed people from the Senate
- The Pope ordered cats killed during the Black Plague (common myth!)
- Benjamin Franklin formally proposed the turkey as national bird

It's at https://historale.com — streak-based, free, no signup.

I tried to make the fake ones genuinely hard to spot.
What's your best streak?

I made a free game where you guess if history is real or fake.

The real events sound completely made up:
📜 Australia lost a war against emus
📜 A pope put a dead body on trial
📜 Napoleon was attacked by rabbits

The fake ones sound totally legit.

Try it: historale.com
```

**Tweet 2 (share bait):**
```
Did you know the last guillotine execution in France happened the
same year Star Wars came out?

That's real.

But "Julius Caesar banned left-handed senators"?

That's fake.

## 3. GETTING TO THE TOP OF GOOGLE

### Step 1: Google Search Console (do this TODAY, 10 min)

1. Go to https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Click "Add Property"
3. Choose "URL prefix" → enter https://historale.com
4. Verify via DNS (Vercel makes this easy) or HTML tag
5. Once verified, go to "URL Inspection" → paste your homepage URL → click "Request Indexing"

This tells Google "hey, my site exists, come look at it." Without this
step, Google might not find you for weeks.

### Step 2: Create a sitemap.xml (5 min)

Create a file called sitemap.xml and upload it to your repo:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>https://historale.com/</loc>
    <lastmod>2026-02-27</lastmod>
    <priority>1.0</priority>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>https://historale.com/privacy.html</loc>
    <lastmod>2026-02-27</lastmod>
    <priority>0.3</priority>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>https://historale.com/about.html</loc>
    <lastmod>2026-02-27</lastmod>
    <priority>0.3</priority>
  </url>
</urlset>
```

Then submit it in Google Search Console → Sitemaps → paste "sitemap.xml"

### Step 3: Create a robots.txt (2 min)

Upload this as robots.txt to your repo:

```
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://historale.com/sitemap.xml
```

### Step 4: Your Biggest SEO Advantage — UNIQUE NAME

Since "Historale" is a made-up word with zero competition, you should
rank #1 for "historale" within 1-2 weeks of Google indexing you. This is
your single biggest advantage over someone using a generic name.

Every time someone shares their score and a friend Googles "historale",
they find you instantly. This creates a virtuous cycle:

Play → Share → Friend Googles → Finds you → Plays → Shares → ...

### Step 5: Target Broader Keywords Over Time

Once you rank #1 for "historale", work toward ranking for:
- "real or fake history game" (low competition)
- "history trivia game online" (medium competition)
- "games like wordle" (high competition, but huge traffic)
- "daily trivia game" (medium competition)

How? The Reddit/HN/Product Hunt posts create backlinks. Google sees
authoritative sites linking to you and boosts your ranking. Each viral
post = dozens of backlinks = higher authority = better rankings.

### Step 6: Page Speed (already done)

Your site is a single HTML file on Vercel. It'll score 95-100 on
Google PageSpeed Insights. This is a ranking factor and you're already
crushing it without trying.
